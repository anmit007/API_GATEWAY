FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND 
 

- we need an intermediate layer b/w the client side and the microservices
- using this middle end, when client sends request , we will be able to make decision which microservice should actually respond to this request
- we can do message validation , response transformation , rate limiting 
- we try to prepare an API-GATEWAY that acts as this middle-end.
